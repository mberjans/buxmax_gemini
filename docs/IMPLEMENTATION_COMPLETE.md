## ðŸš€ Implementation Approach

### For AI Coding Agents

The documentation is specifically designed for autonomous execution:

1. **Sequential Execution:**
   - Follow ticket order (1 â†’ 34)
   - Respect dependencies explicitly listed in each ticket
   - Complete all tasks in a ticket before moving to next

2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
   - Every ticket follows: Tests â†’ Implementation â†’ Verification
   - Never skip test tasks
   - Run tests after each ticket completion

3. **Task Granularity:**
   - Each task is atomic (2-5 minutes)
   - Clear, single-action descriptions
   - No ambiguity in requirements

4. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Check off tasks: `[ ]` â†’ `[x]`
   - Commit after each ticket with descriptive message
   - Update checklist in git for visibility

5. **Verification:**
   - Run all tests after implementation
   - Verify acceptance criteria met
   - Manual verification steps included

### For Human Developers

The tickets can also be used by human development teams:

1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - Each ticket represents 1-2 weeks of work
   - Can be assigned to individual developers
   - Clear acceptance criteria for sprint reviews

2. **Code Review:**
   - Detailed requirements enable thorough reviews
   - Test coverage requirements ensure quality
   - File lists help reviewers focus

3. **Onboarding:**
   - New developers can understand system from tickets
   - Clear dependencies show system architecture
   - Comprehensive documentation in each ticket
