## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence:
1. **TICKET-031** (Source Discovery) - Expands content sources
2. **TICKET-032** (JavaScript Scraping) - Enables scraping of discovered sources
3. **TICKET-034** (Monitoring) - Track health of new scraping infrastructure
4. **TICKET-033** (ESP Integration) - Enhance newsletter distribution

### Alternative Sequence:
- If newsletter distribution is a priority, implement TICKET-033 earlier
- If monitoring is critical, implement TICKET-034 first
