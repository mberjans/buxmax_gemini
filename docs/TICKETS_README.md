## 🔗 Dependencies

Tickets have clear dependencies to enable:
- **Sequential work**: Critical path tickets must be done in order
- **Parallel work**: Independent tickets can be done simultaneously
- **Incremental progress**: Each phase builds on previous phases
- **Testability**: Tests can be written alongside implementation

### Critical Path
The minimum set of tickets that must be completed sequentially:
1. Foundation (BUXMAX-001 → 010)
2. Core Models (BUXMAX-011 → 013 → 025)
3. Scraping (BUXMAX-031 → 039 → 046)
4. Processing (BUXMAX-049 → 051)
5. Frontend (BUXMAX-071 → 073)
6. Testing (BUXMAX-096 → 110)
7. Deployment (BUXMAX-111 → 120)
8. Launch (BUXMAX-121 → 122)

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Every ticket includes testing requirements:
- **Unit tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration tests**: Test components working together
- **E2E tests**: Test user workflows
- **Coverage target**: >80% for all code
